2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Design_MicroBlaze_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Design_MicroBlaze_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset_rtl_0 relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_rtl_0_rxd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uart_rtl_0_txd relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p.
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p] (Source: F:/Advance Hardware Eng/Lab_4/Lab_4.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 10))

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports diff_clock_rtl_0_clk_p] (Source: F:/Advance Hardware Eng/Lab_4/Lab_4.srcs/constrs_1/new/constraints.xdc (Line: 10))
